        <h2>Noom</h2>
        <p>During my internship at Noom, I worked on a variety of print and digital projects for both internal and external tools and resources. One of my largest undertakings, was the redesign of the in-app signup flow. As the sole product designer on this project, I was responsible for all stages of this process including research, ideation, prototyping and testing.</p>

            <h6>Background</h6>
            <p>Before I get into the nitty gritty of this project, there's a few details you'll need to know.</p>
            <p class="heading"><b>First</b>, Noom has 2 core user groups, B2B and B2C users. B2B users are recommended to Noom programs by their healthcare/insurance providers and are automatically paid users. B2C users are individuals who access Noom directly, and can enter the app as free or paid users. Free users always have the option of enrolling into a paid program.</p>
            <p class="heading"><b>Second</b>, in order to enroll into a paid program, both B2B and B2C users need to input a Unique Program ID (UPID) sent to them when they initially enroll in a paid program.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="constraints">
            <h6>Objective</h6>
            <p>The overall objective of this project was to improve the user experience for all users coming into the app with or without a UPID. The largest problems with the current flow in were:
                <ul>
                    <li>The signup is confusing Free users, who are asking for a UPID.</li>
                    <li>Users are downloading the app but not completing signup.</li>
                    <li>New Users entering the program do not know what the program offers nor do they understand the paid programs.</li>
                    <li>The signup is different on IOS/Android making collateral and support confusing for user onboarding. This also makes gathering both reporting and user data very complicated.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="heading">On top of solving some of the problems with the current signup, I was also hoping to incorporate the newly designed buyflow (a second project I was running concurrently) into the signup flow.</p>
            <div class="problem">
                <p>It's important to note that improvements to the onboarding collateral and in-app onboarding were not within the scope of this project.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="constraints">
            <h6>Current Flow</h6>
            <p>Upon analysis of the current signup, it was clear that the flow would need to be drastically altered to incorporate the necessary changes to address the problems with the current flow. While the journey itself appears very simple, it is filled with redundant input fields and screens which users indicated were frustrating. Additionally, this over simplified flow provides to context or information about the app to the user.</p>
            <img src="images/noom_currentflow.png" class="full_image">
            <p>The biggest issue with the current signup process was the initial account creation screen. This screen is where the signup flow experienced the largest drop off. I hypothesized that it was due to the confusing language and layout of this screen.</p>
            <div class="center">
              <img src="images/noom_currentselection.png" class="full_image" style="max-width: 270px;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="constraints">
          <h6>Research</h6>
          <p>In order to develop a better understanding of the typical signup flow for weight loss and medical apps, I completed the signup process for a variety of different mobile services. I was specifically looking to understand how companies framed personal questions such as weight and weight loss, where (or if) they placed their upsell in the flow, and how they segregated paid and free users.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="constraints">
            <h6>User Stories</h6>
            <p>In order to create a more clear set of objectives for this project, the team collaboratively created a set of user stories to guide design decisions. These user stories outline tasks and objectives that users should be able to successfully complete/understand. They were developed using past user test results, user feedback and market research.</p>
            <img src="images/noom_userstories.png" class="full_image">
            <div class="problem">
              <p>Throughout this process, it was important to keep in mind that the demographic for B2B users is very different from B2C users. Their age, interests, and technical expertise are on opposite ends of the spectrum, and this experience needed to be catered to both users.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="constraints">
            <h6>Proposed User Flow</h6>
            <p>In order to address the problems with the current signup, the changes needed to occur at a process level. Specifically, the pathing of users through the signup process needed to be improved. Using the user stories, data requirements and technical constraints involved in this project, I proposed the following user flow.</p>
            <img src="images/noom_newflow.png" class="full_image" >
            <p>At first glance this flow is much more complex, but this is because I hoped to create an optimized experience for each user entering the app. It may also appear much longer, but this is due to the addition of the buyflow. Apart from that, the main changes in this flow are with the location and method of separating free and paid users.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="constraints">
            <h6>User Testing and Iteration</h6>
            <p>In order to validate my proposed flow, I created a high fidelity prototype for user testing. Testing was conducted with the help of the in-house user research team. Since there are so many different users types signing up for the app, it was important to test all the user scenarios. A total of 13 different user tests were conducted, the user scenarios of these tests are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>B2B user</li> 
              <li>B2C free user</li> 
              <li>B2C free user who purchases in the signup flow</li>
              <li>B2C paid user</li>
              <li>B2B/B2C user who already has an account</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After each user test, we reviewed and consolidated the results, and I implemented the recommended changes for the next round of testing. It was important during these tests to ensure that changing one part of the designs from results from one test scenario would not affect the experience of a user from another test scenario.</p>
            <div class="problem">
              <p>While initially I was opposed to using the language UPID since I believe it could be the cause of the confusion during signup, the tests revealed that for B2C paid users, it was the most successful method of having them signup for the correct paid experience without confusing free users.

        <div class="constraints">
            <h6>Final Design</h6>
            <p>After consolidating all the test results and iteratively developing the design, the final product flow was created. Finalizing the designs took a great deal longer that I originally expected, since each input field needed a unique error state.</p>
            <img src="images/noom_finaldesigns.png" class="full_image"/>
            <h5 class="caption">Final Design Specifications</h5>
            <p>For a closer look at this flow, you can go through the final tested prototype <a href="https://marvelapp.com/28bhd7a" target="_blank">here</a>. Note that the screens in the prototype have been intentionally cut off at the bottom. This was done so that during testing, the bottom of the screen containing the CTA did not fall below the fold. The biggest difference between the initially proposed new flow and the final product are in the three screens used to separate free and paid users.</p>
            <img src="images/noom_mobile.png" class="full_image" >
            <p>Using these screens, all of the users in the various test scenarios were able to go through the signup process without confusion. Specifically each user signed up for the correct experience (paid or free). The first screen helps path B2B users, the second paid B2C users and the last leads to the buyflow for free B2C users.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="constraints">
          <h6>Next Steps</h6>
          <p>This project was in the process of being implemented when my internship came to an end. I was able to deliver the final design specifications (in Zeplin), and developed a plan for testing the success of this design after implementation. Working with the Product Manager, we developed a set of metrics to analyze the success of this redesign after implementation. These metrics were chosen to identify if users were signing up for the correct experience, if the upsell raised conversion, and if more users were completing sign up (and if not, where did they drop off?). Using these metrics, the design will be tweaked in the future to address the results.
