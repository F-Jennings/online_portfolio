      <h2>Banana Republic</h2>
      <p>During my time at Sequence, I was given the opportunity to redesign Banana Republic's (BR) online store. As the sole Interaction Designer on the project, I worked closely with a team of designers, marketers and engineers to deliver a prototype, accompanying specifications and a user experience guideline.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slim">
      <div class=" space">
        <h6>Problem</h6>
        <p>From kick-off disccusiones, it became clear that BR couldn't identify the problem that they wanted us to solve. Although they knew that there was low engagement on web and almost no engagement on mobile, the reason for these results was unclear.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="space">
        <h6>Process</h6>
        <div class="constraints">
          <h6>Identify the problem</h6>
          <p>We did an in-depth site audit of the current (past) BR website revealed the following pain points:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Lack of navigation</b> - except for the main navigation, it was difficult to browse the site, and required concious effort by the user</li>
            <li><b>Lack of experience continuity</b> - the site was full of end points where the user was forced to navigate backwards to continue shopping</li>
            <li><b>Poor product discovery</b> - Products and options to purchase we're revealed very late into the experience, minumum of 3 screens deep</li>
            <li><b>Poor mobile experience</b> - the site was not responsive therefore qausi-impossible to navigate on mobile web</li>
            <li><b>Too much emphasis on Sale</b> - the visual hierarchy of the elements on the home page all directed the user to discounted content </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The last pain point came directly from the BR brand designers. In the new iteration of the site, they were hoping to establish BR as a more high retailer rather than the discount shop their site portrays them to be.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="constraints">
          <h6>Market Research</h6>
          <p>We then researched both competitors and industry leaders and ran workshops to collect BR's favorite experiences. We focused on discovering sites that solved the pain points of the BR site. The most popular sites were further scrutinized to identify the features, layouts or just general experiennces that made them successful.

            <div class="problem">
              <p>During this discovery phase, it became clear that the BR team did not have a clear set of high level goals for their site. In order to provide more direction to the project, Sequence created user personas and experience pillars to guide decisions. </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="constraints">
          <h6>Personas</h6>
          <p>Using the data insights and user information from BROL, I helped create detailed personas for the BROL shoppers. Users were segmented based on their shopping behaviours with specific focus placed on their individual goals and influential conversion metrics (outlined below). The ideal shopping experience and their importance to BR was also included in each persona.</p>
          </ul>
          <img src="images/brol_personas.png" class="full_image">
          <h5 class="caption">Banana Republic online shopper personas</h5>
          <p>These personas helped guide the team in decision making and ideation. "Is this for her?" became a very common question thrown around in our worksessions and sprints.</p>
          <div class="problem">
            <p>Designing for these very conflicting personas was a big challenge. While BR hoped to move away from their discount shopping experience (satisfied the Discount shopper), it was discovered that she contributed to the majority of their revenue and therefore her experience was still a priority.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="constraints">
          <h6>Ideation</h6>
          <p>Using both the personas and research the Sequence team developed an extensive list of possible solutions to the initial pain points. These were organized by feasibility, importance to the user, importance to the business and which pain point they solved. The development of this list was an iterative process where each was refined, removed, added in turn with input from the BROL and Gap Inc. designers and engineers. </p>

          <div class="problem">
            <p> In order to assist in organizing the proposed solutions, BR experience pillars were developed. The helped ensure that the BR, Gap Inc. and Sequence team were aligned on the goal of the project.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="constraints">
          <h6>Prototyping</h6>
          <p>The solutions developed in the ideation stage were all prototyped at different levels of fidelity throughout the organization process. While all the prototypes were initially created with Axure and good old pen and paper, when it came to the final stages, we found that none of these tools could demonstrate responsive solutions. I then proposed and created a fully responsive HTML/CSS prototype to properly demonstrate the final list of desired features/solutions.

      <div class=" space">
        <h6>Deliverables</h6>
        <p>The final deliverables for BR included a fully responsive test-ready prototype and accompanying Experience Specification as well as an Experience Design Guide. The specification was a detailed list of all the features designer for the prototype including a grid system, breakpoints and responsive behviour. The Experience Guideline summarized the project findings for future use by the BR team. To see the full project, please contact me! </p>
