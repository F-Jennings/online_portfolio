      <h2>Banana Republic</h2>
      <p>This project involved redesigning the home and department pages of Banana Republic's online store. My role on this project was as Interaction Designer. I worked closely with the Banana Republic and Gap Inc. team to develop new features that would improve the navigation and continuity of the shopping experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slim">
      <div class=" space">
        <h6>Problem</h6>
        <p>The Banana Republic online store was performing poorly due to difficulty discovering product and navigating the site, particularly on mobile. This frustrating experience led to serious dropoff on product and purchase pages, and very low conversion rates.</p>
        <div class="constraints">
        <h6>Constraints</h6>
        <p> Because BR (Banana Republic) is part of the Gap Inc. family, there were severe limitations on what could be changed on their site. The navigation, photography and product pages could not be touched. Gap Inc. also has very strict design and layout guidelines for their web stores to maintain consistency across all their brands.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="space">
        <h6>Process</h6>
        <div class="constraints">
          <h6>Site Audit</h6>
          <p>An indepth site audit was conducted on the current (past) Banana Republic website. The audit revealed the following pain points:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Poor discovery of navigation</li>
            <li>Lack of continuity in experience beyond product page</li>
            <li>Poor product discovery</li>
            <li>Too much emphasis on Sale</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The last pain point came directly from the BR brand team as they are hoping to establish the brand as an exclusive, high end store rather than the discount shop their site portrays them to be</p></p>
        </div>
        <div class="constraints">
          <h6>Market Research</h6>
          <p>Extensive research into both competitors and industry leaders was conducted to gather a collection of the the BR and Gap Inc team's favorite experiences. Specific focus was placed on sites that performed well responsivly. The most popular sites were categorize and analyzed to identify the reasons why they were considered successful.

          <div class="problem">
            <p>During this discovery phase, it became clear that the BR team did not have a clear set of high level goals for their site. In order to provide more direction to the project, Sequence created user personas and experience pillars to guide decisions. </p>

          <h6>Personas</h6>
          <p>BR provided full access to their data insights and user information to help create indepth, accurate personas. Shoppers were segmented based on their 
            Breakdown of personas: 40% sale, 20% New arrivals, 30% categorical, 10% editorial Developed to understand the mindset of our shopper as she navigates through the site. The ideal shopping experience for each persona and their importance to BR was also determined. Important to note the percentage of each category the personas did not really align with the brand that BROL was aiming for.</p>

        <div class="constraints">
          <h6>Ideation</h6>
          <p>Using our findings, we determined, organized and prioritized the features and changes that could solve the initial problem. These features were organized by feasibility, importance to the user, importance to the business and which pain point they solved. The development of this list was an iterative process where each was refined, removed, added in turn with input from the BROL design team, BROL development team and GAP Inc design team. From this we also established the experience guidelines to ensure that the GAP, BR and Sequence team was aligned and focused.</p>
