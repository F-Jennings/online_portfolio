      <h2>Banana Republic</h2>
      <p>During my time at Sequence, I was given the opportunity to collaborate on the future on Banana Republic's website as it transitions to a responsive design. As the sole Interaction Designer on the project, I worked closely with a Banana Republic’s Strategy and Design teams, Gap’s User Experience team, and Sequence to deliver: a clear definition of four primary shopper segments, a process book for approaching design and testing, specifications for a fully responsive website and a working HTML prototype that models responsive behavior across devices.</li>
        </ul>

      <h6>Process</h6>
      <div class="constraints first">
        <h6>Define</h6>
        <p>The first step in this design process was to define the problems that must be solved. This required an understanding of the project’s context, audience, and scope, and involved both desk research and user research. Synthesizing the findings revealed important insights that informed the following phases in this project,</p>
      </div>
      <div class="constraints">
        <h6>Industry Research</h6>
        <p>Alongside the Sequence team, I helped conduct primary and secondary industry research. This research indicated new online customer segmentations that shed light on the possible shortcomings of the BR site.</p>

        <h5 class="caption">Industry Research Walls</h5>
        <div class="problem">
          <p>During the preliminary research, it was discovered that BR did not have a set high level goals for their site. Thus epxerience pillars were developed to define site objectives and eventually validate success.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="constraints">
        <h6>Personas</h6>
        <p>Using Gap's consumer insights, I helped create detailed personas that included each shoppers' behaviour on the site and personality attributes. We focused on how different personas approached online shopping on BananaRepublic.com. We questioned everything from their brand loyalty to the devices they used to engage with the brand.</p>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/brol_personas.png" class="full_image">
        <h5 class="caption">Banana Republic online shopper personas</h5>
        <p>These personas helped guide the team in ideation of future features. <i>"Is this for her?"</i> became a guiding mantra in prioritizing new features.</p>
        <div class="problem">
          <p>Designing for these very conflicting personas was a big challenge. While BR hoped to move away from their discount shopping experience (Marissa - Discount shopper), she contributed significantly to revenue and therefore, she was still important to BR.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="constraints first">
        <h6>Pain Points</h6>
        <p>With insights in hand, the team could clearly identify the pain points for each user and prioritize them against current business goals. Once pain points were established, the team created a clear statement indicating the problem(s) to be solved. The problem statement aligns the Design and UX teams so they can begin to ideate and explore possible solutions. </p>

      <div class="constraints">
        <h6>Ideation</h6>
        <p>The goal of this exercise was to tackle the big problems togetther and build a hypothesis of what might work. The end result was a list of quick sketches with a description of what was happening, accompanied by hypothesis and an idea of how to test and validate the assumption. These sketches were organized by importance to the business and categorizd based on which pain point they addressed. </p>

      <div class="constraints">
        <h6>Prototyping</h6>
        <p>The solutions developed in the ideation stage were all prototyped at different levels of fidelity. While all the prototypes were initially sketches with descriptions, the higher priority features were created using Axure. , when it came to the final stages, we found that none of these tools could demonstrate responsive solutions. I then proposed and created a fully responsive HTML/CSS prototype to properly demonstrate the final list of desired features/solutions.

    <div class=" space">
      <h6>Deliverables</h6>
      <p>The final deliverables for BR included a fully responsive test-ready prototype and accompanying Experience Specification as well as an Experience Design Guide. The specification was a detailed list of all the features designer for the prototype including a grid system, breakpoints and responsive behviour. The Experience Guideline summarized the project findings for future use by the BR team. To see the full project, please contact me! </p>

    <h6>Next Steps</h6>
    <p>User testing helps us validate or disprove our proposed design solutions. For the Banana Republic team, this means tprototype that can be tested in the Gap Research Lab or by team members directly. After testing is complete, it is necessary to continue refining any lingering pain points that were not resolved. This process repeats until the problems are resolved.</p>

      <h6>Results</h6>
      <p>Some of the features I designed are in the BROL site live now! </p>
