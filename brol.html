      <h2>Banana Republic</h2>
      <p>Banana Republic approached aimed improve the online experience for their retail store. This involved creating a timeless, easily edited fully responsive experience which assisted users in discovery of product and increased conversion. My role on this project was as Interaction Designer working closely with the BR team to create an improved flow and design for BR online.</p>
    </div>
      <div class=" space">
        <h6>Problem</h6>
        <p>The Banana Republic site was performing poorly due to difficulty discovering product and navigating the site, particularly on mobile. This frustrating experience led to serious dropoff in engagement on product and purchase pages, and very low conversion rates.</p>
        <div class="constraints">
        <h6>Constraints</h6>
        <p>We could not touch the site navigation, cannot change any photography, cannot change the branding and must comply to Gap Inc Guidelines. Focus on Home and Section page, no category or product pages. </p>
      </div>

        <h6>Process</h6>
        <div class="constraints">
          <h6>Site Audit</h6>
          <p>The audit revealed the following pain points of BROL:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Poor, inaccessible Navigation</li>
            <li>Lack of natural user pathing/parsing/direction</li>
            <li>Lack of product surfacing</li>
            <li>Too much emphasis on Sale</li>
          </ul>
          <p>BROL also revealed during the audit that they were hoping to establish their brand more on their site as a high end, business to casual store , NOT the constantly 40% off store (downplay the Sale). </p></p>

          <h6>Market Research</h6>
          <p>Extensive research into the best/worst of online shopping was conducted to identify the state of the industry (where competitors were succeeding and failing). determine standard elements/experiences and ensure that the site could conform to the GAP Inc brand (site audit of Gap, Old Navy and Athleta).

          <h6>Personas</h6>
          <p>Breakdown of personas: 40% sale, 20% New arrivals, 30% categorical, 10% editorial Developed to understand the mindset of our shopper as she navigates through the site. The ideal shopping experience for each persona and their importance to BR was also determined. Important to note the percentage of each category the personas did not really align with the brand that BROL was aiming for.</p>

          <h6>Ideation</h6>
          <p>Using our findings, we determined, organized and prioritized the features and changes that could solve the initial problem. These features were organized by feasibility, importance to the user, importance to the business and which pain point they solved. The development of this list was an iterative process where each was refined, removed, added in turn with input from the BROL design team, BROL development team and GAP Inc design team. From this we also established the experience guidelines to ensure that the GAP, BR and Sequence team was aligned and focused.</p>
