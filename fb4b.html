      <h2>Facebook for Business</h2>
      <p>Facebook for Business gives the latest news, tips and best practices for using Facebook to help meet business goals. The team approached Sequence to redesign the network of sites that create Facebook for Business (FB4B). My role on the project was as Interaction Desginer. Working with a team of Sequence designers and a large group of FB4B designers and  senior stakeholders, I helped lay the groundwork for the design of the new unified FB4B website. This involved combining the separate sites, and creating the foundation for the new atomic design system.</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>FB4B websites were difficult to navigate, and users were failing to find ther product and services they were searching for. The site felt dated, and did not properly reflect the mission and identity of FB4B.

        <h6>Points of Interest</h6>
        <p> Designing a consumer facing site that serves as the landing for the majority of Facebook's income was an amazign opportunity. Major issues such as globalization and localization serious information architecture.

        <h6>Vision Piece</h6>
        <p>Because of the sheer number of stakeholders involved in this project, it became very important to advocate for the necessity of this redesign. In order to promote the rebrand abd web redesign, and showcase the benefits of this porject, a beautiful Vision Piece was desgined. I helped create many of the assets on the pages as well as all the mobile versions of the piece.
        <div class="problem">
          <p>Unfortunately this piece cannot be displayed on this site. For more details about the final product please get in touch!

      <h6>Information Architecture</h6>
      <p>In order to create a central site where all FB4B businesses could be found, it was necessary to combine many of the smaller microsites. The large network of sites and wikis that make up the entire FB4B site needed to be accessible through one navigation system. This iterative process resulted in a very simplified version of the site architecture. </p>
      <div class="problem">
        <p>This part of the project was particularly tricky. Explaining the reasons for merging the smaller microsites to all stakeholders was a challending but sucessful part of the redesign.

      <p> While I cannot share too much on this ongoing work, I will say that it is one of the most interesting projects I have had the opportunity to take part in. Not only is it amazing to design for such a large audience, but due to Facebook's reach, design problems such as accessibility, globalization, etc. came into play.</p>
