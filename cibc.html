      <h2>Canadian Imperial Commerce Bank</h2>
      <p>This project was a part of a larger business redesign of the business account opening of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Capco was hoping to help CIBC shift their account opening online, and used the small business account opening for the proposal. As the sole desinger on the project, I was responsible for research, internal testing, wireframing, prototyping and visual design. </p>

        <h6>Technical Requirements</h6>
        <p>This project was used as a proof-of-concept for moving account opening online. It required an in-depth understanding of the bank's legal and financial processes, and possible features or products included in the ideal account opening process. </p>

          <p>It's important to recognize that although this project had "technical requirements" this project had no techinical constraints. Being a proof of concept, I had virtually no limits to the.</p>

        <h6>Market Research</h6>
        <p>Since CIBC didn't have any corporate online account opening processes, there were no standard practices available to use as a foundation for these designs. Therefore I used a combination of the CIBC personal banking site and the online account opening of other financial institutions to understand the industry standard.</p>
        <div class="problem">
          <p>Due to the limited time frame, the research focused mainly on Canadian banks so that the final design would have the correct process.</p>

        <h6>User Flow</h6>
        <p>Based on the industry research, I created a simple flow that involved the standard entrypoint, features, and necessary information for online account opening. This flow included additional upsells and product recommendations to showcase the potential beneficial opportunities online account opening could provide.</p>

        <h6>Wireframe & User Testing</h6>
        <p>Using low fidelity mocks, I conducted some simple, iterative, user tests as a sanity check for the process I developed. These tests resulted in two main findings. The first was the optimal location in the flow for the upsell, and the second was that the sheer amount input required for account opening made the experience feel too long and redious.</p>

        <h6>Visual Design</h6>
        <p>After iterating on the flow and the mocks, I finished this project by creating a final high fidelity prototype for the CIBC executives. This prototype was designed to act as a microsite and was created to follow the CIBC brand. You can see the full <a href="#"> final designs here</a>.</p>

          <p>Specific focus was placed on creating a delightful experience for the input form. Although it was crowded with legal consent forms and financial information, it was designed for easy, interactive input.</p>

        <h6>Mobile Web</h6>
        <p>A very last minute ask from the Capco team was creating a mobile web version of this process. Due to time constraints, only the account recomendation process was created. Particular care was taken to ensure that the form created for web did not overwhelm the user on mobile.</p>
